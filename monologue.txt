The Dark Veil Caravan... our men born beneath starless skies, skin touched by shadow's deepest hue. Our mothers, sisters, daughters - they move as living shadows, dark veils flowing like liquid night. Shar, Blessed Be Her Darkness, marked us as Her own.

We followed the ancient paths, our black wagons moving only when darkness ruled the sky. Our camps appeared like shadows at dusk and vanished before dawn. The women's quarters - sacred spaces where even moonlight dared not peek beneath their veils. Their whispered prayers to Shar guided our journey.

Our traditions ran deeper than blood. Men learned to read darkness in the land, to find paths where shadows pooled. The women... they kept darker secrets. Behind their veils, they spoke prophecies in shadow-tongue, read omens in the void between stars. The Umbral Heart responded to their touch in ways even I never fully understood.

Each family knew its place. The men - warriors, scouts, guardians of our physical realm. The veiled ones - keepers of ritual, protectors of sacred relics, their covered faces hiding wisdom that would shatter lesser minds. Even now, I hear their veiled whispers in my dreams, guiding my path.

When the light-seekers attacked, they thought our scattered caravans meant weakness. They never understood - like shadow itself, we are strongest when divided, impossible to truly destroy. Each veiled mother took a different path into darkness, bearing our sacred treasures to secret places.

Now I walk alone, my dark features marking me as Shar's chosen. The loss of the Heart burns like ice in my blood. But remember this - the light can only push back the shadows, and no light burns forever. When the flames fade, and all returns to shadow's embrace. In that final darkness, they will understand - they merely borrowed what belonged to shadow all along.
